Specifically, applications are sought for fundamental research on plants that will improve biomass characteristics, biomass yield, or sustainability. Systems biology approaches to identify genetic indicators enabling plants to be efficiently bred or manipulated, or research to predict phenotype from underlying genotype that could lead to improved feedstock characterization and sustainability are also encouraged. Renewable energy from biomass has the potential to reduce or remove dependency on fossil fuels as well as reduce negative environmental impacts from emissions of greenhouse gases and toxic pollutants. Realizing this potential will require the simultaneous development of high yielding biomass production systems and bioconversion technologies that efficiently convert biomass energy into the forms of energy usable by industry. Most agricultural research to date has focused on enhancing the production of seeds, roots and tubers that are used for food and feed production. However, these improvements in food crops have frequently been directed towards increases in starch content with a corresponding reduction of lignocelluloses accumulation. Research applications are solicited for genomics-based research that will lead to improved utilization of plant biomass for the production of fuels such as ethanol or renewable chemical feedstocks. This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) co ntinues a commitment, initiated in 2006, to conduct a fundamental research program in biomass genomics, to provide the scientific foundation to facilitate the use of lignocellulosic materials, either primary material or agricultural residues, for bioenergy and biofuels. The rationale for developing lignocellulosic crops for energy is that less intensive production techniques and poorer quality land can be used for these crops, thereby avoiding competition with food production on better quality land.",99,6000000,10,G,kim.laing@science.doe.gov,kim.laing@science.doe.gov,"Kimberlie J.

To accomplish this goal, the recipient institution will collect new data to evaluate the status of fish eating bird population health relative to reference (non AOC) areas and to these same areas as measured in the past. The recipient institution must have a proven record of experience in working with these types of bird colonies in the Great Lakes and measuring specific immunological endpoints in order to maintain scientific integrity and comparability of data. In addition to the continuing work on colonial waterbird populations, reproduction, and immune function, the recipient institution will measure the same endpoints at an additional site (Bellow Island), evaluate potential influence of contaminants of emerging concern to those endpoints, and screen water and sediments samples for these contaminants in the studied watersheds.
