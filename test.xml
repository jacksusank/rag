        <Description>The Office of Press and Public Diplomacy of the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs of the U.S. Department of State, in coordination with the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs and the Bureau of Education and Cultural Affairs, announces an open competition for a cooperative agreement to implement the Edmund S. Muskie Graduate Internship Program (herein referred to as the Muskie Internship Program). The Muskie Internship Program is designed to promote mutual understanding and foster democratization and the transition to market economies in Eurasia through intensive professional education. Through this program, 35-40 Muskie Interns will begin a four-month professional internship in the United States immediately upon the completion of their Fulbright Foreign Student Program. These internships provide an opportunity to further professional development, as well as reinforce skills gained during academic study.</Description>

        <Description>The U.S. Department of Energy&amp;apos;s Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), hereby announce their interest in receiving applications for genomics based research that will lead to the improved use of biomass and plant feedstocks for the production of fuels such as ethanol or renewable chemical feedstocks. Specifically, applications are sought for fundamental research on plants that will improve biomass characteristics, biomass yield, or sustainability. Systems biology approaches to identify genetic indicators enabling plants to be efficiently bred or manipulated, or research to predict phenotype from underlying genotype that could lead to improved feedstock characterization and sustainability are also encouraged. Renewable energy from biomass has the potential to reduce or remove dependency on fossil fuels as well as reduce negative environmental impacts from emissions of greenhouse gases and toxic pollutants. Realizing this potential will require the simultaneous development of high yielding biomass production systems and bioconversion technologies that efficiently convert biomass energy into the forms of energy usable by industry. Most agricultural research to date has focused on enhancing the production of seeds, roots and tubers that are used for food and feed production. However, these improvements in food crops have frequently been directed towards increases in starch content with a corresponding reduction of lignocelluloses accumulation. Research applications are solicited for genomics-based research that will lead to improved utilization of plant biomass for the production of fuels such as ethanol or renewable chemical feedstocks. This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) co ntinues a commitment, initiated in 2006, to conduct a fundamental research program in biomass genomics, to provide the scientific foundation to facilitate the use of lignocellulosic materials, either primary material or agricultural residues, for bioenergy and biofuels. The rationale for developing lignocellulosic crops for energy is that less intensive production techniques and poorer quality land can be used for these crops, thereby avoiding competition with food production on better quality land.</Description>

        <Description>This program will provide assistance to an institution to investigate and monitor of the effects of environmental contaminants on the breeding population numbers, reproduction, and immunological health of fish eating birds found in the Saginaw Bay, Raisin River and other Great Lakes Areas of Concern (AOCs), building on previous investigations in past years. To accomplish this goal, the recipient institution will collect new data to evaluate the status of fish eating bird population health relative to reference (non AOC) areas and to these same areas as measured in the past. The recipient institution must have a proven record of experience in working with these types of bird colonies in the Great Lakes and measuring specific immunological endpoints in order to maintain scientific integrity and comparability of data. In addition to the continuing work on colonial waterbird populations, reproduction, and immune function, the recipient institution will measure the same endpoints at an additional site (Bellow Island), evaluate potential influence of contaminants of emerging concern to those endpoints, and screen water and sediments samples for these contaminants in the studied watersheds. This is a notice of intent to award a single source grant without competition to Calvin College with Dr. Keith Grasman working on the project under justification 505DM 2.14B (2) &amp;amp; (4). The Service intends to award to this recipient without competition because Dr. Grasman is uniquely qualified to perform this study. He is the researcher that has demonstrated the associations between PCBs and suppression of T-cell-mediated immunity in herring gull and Caspian tern chicks at highly contaminated sites in the Great Lakes as well as associations with altered antibody-mediated immunity (Grasman et al. 1996. Grasman and Fox 2001, Grasman et al. 2012). Because Dr. Grasman has developed and used these immunological methods at these study sites over the past 20 years, data that he generates under this grant can be directly compared with past data to determine trends and restoration of Beneficial Use Impairments.</Description>
